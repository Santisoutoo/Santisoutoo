🚀 AI Engineer passionate about aviation industry

</div>


I am currently completing my degree in Artificial Intelligence Engineering, with a strong interest in deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and data analytics.

I am particularly passionate about the aerospace sector and working on projects involving agent-based AI systems applied to aviation. I enjoy developing intelligent solutions that simulate and optimize complex environments, combining AI techniques with real-world applications.I am currently completing my degree in Artificial Intelligence Engineering, with a strong interest in deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and data analytics.
