# ‚úàÔ∏è Welcome to my digital portfolio! üóº    
üöÄ AI Engineer passionate about aviation industry

</div>


I am currently completing my degree in Artificial Intelligence Engineering, with a strong interest in deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and data analytics.

I am particularly passionate about the aerospace sector and working on projects involving agent-based AI systems applied to aviation. I enjoy developing intelligent solutions that simulate and optimize complex environments, combining AI techniques with real-world applications.

## üè´ University Projects 

[Machine Learning](https://github.com/Santisoutoo/aprendizaje_autom-tico.git): Comprehensive data science project with Jupyter notebooks for EDA, regression modeling, and clustering analysis. Features organized model persistence and systematic versioning for continuous ML workflow improvements.

[APIs REST](https://github.com/Santisoutoo/apiAS.git) Serverless web application using FastAPI + Reflex to display Formula 1 telemetry data from FastF1 API. Implements CRUD operations with Supabase integration for real-time F1 data visualization and race analytics.

Developed in collaboration with @VforVitorio using Git workflows and branching strategies, demonstrating teamwork and version control skills essential for professional software development.


## Current project

- üõ©Ô∏è **[Airport Repository](https://github.com/Santisoutoo/AIrport.git)** - Air Traffic Control simulator with multi-agent systems
  - Developing ATC performance evaluation system.
  - Creating automated reports on controller decision-making under various scenarios
  - Implementing realistic airport operations simulation with multiple aircraft agents using a 3D simulator (X-Plane 12)
